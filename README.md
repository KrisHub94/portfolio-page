# Kristian Huber Portfolio Page

This is the code for my portfolio webpage. The page was made using React and 
serves as an "online bussiness card" to show potential employers some of my 
projects, as well as providing my contact data in case they are interested.
Furthermore, this page is in itself a demonstration of my web development skills.
